# DESIGNING STEPS:

This project will be designed in following progress:

Chess Vision -> Robot Arm -> Chess Clock -> Combine everything

### 1. CHESS VISION
- Chess board detector
- Chess piece movvement tracking

### 2. ROBOT ARM
- 3D and simulator design using SG-90 servo motor for a cheap price.
- Implement using 3D printer or lazer cutting.

### 3. CHESS CLOCK
- A simple clock for chess game, which can be used by both people and robot arm.


### References

- This project are using [neural-chessboard](https://github.com/maciejczyzewski/neural-chessboard) to recognize the chessboard from images.
